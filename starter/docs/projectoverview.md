# Project Overview : Taskify : Task Management API
Railtronics is a leading provider of electronic components, employing thousands of professionals who currently coordinate their work through scattered channels like email, messaging, and phone calls. To streamline operations and foster seamless collaboration, we are developing a modern Taskify Application for Railtronics.

This intuitive platform will centralize task management, enabling employees to efficiently plan, track, and prioritize their work. Key features include real-time updates, automated reminders, easy delegation, and robust collaboration tools—empowering teams to stay aligned and accountable. With mobile access and integration with existing productivity tools, employees can manage tasks anytime, anywhere, boosting productivity and reducing communication silos.

By adopting this solution, Railtronics will enhance workflow visibility, improve team coordination, and ensure every project milestone is met—driving operational excellence across the organization.

This project involves building a secure, scalable backend server for task management, enabling CRUD operations via RESTful endpoints with role-based access control (RBAC). Users interact with the system programmatically through HTTP requests, adhering to industry-standard practices for API design and security.

## How will this help my career?
Learning IAM principles like RBAC, ABAC, authentication, and authorization is crucial for software developers because these concepts form the backbone of application security. Mastery of access control models (RBAC/ABAC) and secure authentication/authorization ensures only the right users access sensitive data, helping prevent breaches and comply with regulations. These skills are highly valued, opening doors to advanced roles in security and enterprise development. They also enable you to design scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly systems, making you a more versatile and in-demand developer in today’s security-conscious tech landscape.

## Project Introduction
The Taskify application is designed to streamline task management within an organization. Key features include:

- **User Registration & Login:** Secure account creation and authentication for all users.
- **Role-Based Access:** Supports multiple user roles, such as regular employees and administrators.
    - **Administrators:** Have full control over user management, including onboarding new users and offboarding employees who leave the company, managing all tasks across company.
    - **Regular Employees:** Can register, log in, manage their own tasks, and update their personal profiles.
- **Task Management:** Allows users to create, update, track, and complete tasks efficiently.
- **Industry Best Practices:** The application is built following industry standards for security, usability, and performance.

This structure will ensure a secure, user-friendly, and efficient environment for managing tasks and users within Railtronics.

## Project Summary

Taskify application is a secure and user-friendly platform for managing tasks within an organization. It features role-based access for administrators and regular employees, allowing admins to manage users and employees to handle their own tasks and profiles. The application follows industry best practices to ensure reliability, security, and efficiency.

## Final Note

As you progress through this project, don’t hesitate to refer back to the course materials—particularly the modules on API design, database integration, and Identity and Access Management. This is your chance to bring together all the concepts you’ve learned and apply them in a meaningful, real-world context. I’m looking forward to seeing your unique approach to this final challenge and hope you find the experience of building your own task management system both rewarding and enjoyable. Best of luck!
